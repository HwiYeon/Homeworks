# Graph Partitioning
We are to partition the nodes of input graph into disjoint (balanced) K subsets such that the cut size is minimized or maximized.
* "Cut size" means the number of edges whose end-points are in different subsets.
* "Balanced" means that the difference between the maximum and the minimum among the cardinalities of K subsets is at most one.
* For maximization problem, do not consider the balance constraint.
